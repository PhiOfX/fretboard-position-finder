## Instructions

Need some little additions in **settings.py**:

For finding templates add this line into TEMPLATES:

```python
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
```

Then insert this block into **settings.py**:

```python

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
]

STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(BASE_DIR), 'fretboard/static_cdn')

FIXTURE_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'fixtures'),
]
```

Fretboard-Position-Finder loads all fingerings, that are stored as **fixtures** with the migrate-command:
```python
python manage.py migrate
```
