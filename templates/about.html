<h1>About</h1>

<p>This web app was born out of a passion for supporting guitarists of all levels in expanding their skills and developing a deeper understanding of their instrument. As a guitar teacher and musician, it was my heartfelt desire to create a tool that would not only support my students but also assist me in my daily practice.</p>

<p>Guitar-positions.org generates all possible fingerings for guitarists in all keys and positions. Our app is organized into categories to make navigation easier:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scales:</strong> From pentatonic scales to melodic minor scales and symmetrical scales.</li>
    <li><strong>Arpeggios:</strong> Triads- and Seventh Chord-Arpeggios.</li>
    <li><strong>Chords:</strong> Triads and Seventh Chords.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you are looking for simple triads, spread triads, or more complex chords, our app provides you with a comprehensive collection of fretboard diagrams and positions. We are particularly proud of the integration of Ted Greene's V-System, which helps you find and master all the notes on the guitar fretboard.</p>

<p>Our app is ideal for students who want to improve their technique as well as advanced guitarists seeking new challenges. With guitar-positions.org, you can take your musical journey to the next level.</p>

<p>This app is an open-source project. We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the code or provide feedback. You can reach us anytime at <a href="mailto:lukas@schoensgibl.com">lukas@schoensgibl.com</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy practicing and discovering!</p>
